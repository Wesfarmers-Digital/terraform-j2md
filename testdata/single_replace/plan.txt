Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # random_id.test must be replaced
-/+ resource "random_id" "test" {
      ~ b64_std     = "qddo6VPNl1g=" -> (known after apply)
      ~ b64_url     = "qddo6VPNl1g" -> (known after apply)
      ~ byte_length = 8 -> 10 # forces replacement
      ~ dec         = "12238365863745263448" -> (known after apply)
      ~ hex         = "a9d768e953cd9758" -> (known after apply)
      ~ id          = "qddo6VPNl1g" -> (known after apply)
    }
