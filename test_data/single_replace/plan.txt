Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution
plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
-/+ destroy and then create replacement

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # local_file.foo must be replaced
-/+ resource "local_file" "foo" {
      ~ content              = "foo!" -> "foo!!!!" # forces replacement
      ~ id                   = "4bf3e335199107182c6f7638efaad377acc7f452" -> (known after apply)
        # (3 unchanged attributes hidden)
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 1 to destroy.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Saved the plan to: /tmp/tfplan

To perform exactly these actions, run the following command to apply:
    terraform apply "/tmp/tfplan"
